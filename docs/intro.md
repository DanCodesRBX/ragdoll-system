# Getting Started

Ragdoll system is designed to be easy to use. It works out of the box for characters which follow the R15 and R6 character formats. Player ragdolls are created automatically without the need for any input from you. The system also automatically creates ragdolls for npcs on the server, simply give the npc model the tag Ragdoll and Ragdoll System will do the rest.
